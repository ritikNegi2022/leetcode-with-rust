# 3512 — Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K

Short solution and notes for problem 3512.

## Problem

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.

 

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,9,7], k = 5

Output: 4

Explanation:

Perform 4 operations on nums[1] = 9. Now, nums = [3, 5, 7].
The sum is 15, which is divisible by 5.


### Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,3], k = 4

Output: 0

Explanation:

The sum is 8, which is already divisible by 4. Hence, no operations are needed.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,2], k = 6

Output: 5

Explanation:

Perform 3 operations on nums[0] = 3 and 2 operations on nums[1] = 2. Now, nums = [0, 0].
The sum is 0, which is divisible by 6.
